1. clone the repository
2. Install the [ebrtc-native plugin](https://github.com/godotengine/webrtc-native)
3. Run "Nuget Restore" in the godot project root directory.
  a. If you do not have Nuget, install it on your machine.
  b. On Windows, I've found that this works easiest through [scoop](https://scoop.sh/) since scoop can also manage the Godot install.
